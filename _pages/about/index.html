Specifically, I found computer to be incredible, and how we are capable of creating machines that can run billions of operations every second. And these machines are common place, not just found in the basments of high end research facilities. Fast forward a few years are now we are living in a world where the internet and machines have become so important, that one of the biggest threats to a individual now is from the digital world. Wether directly or indirectly the rise of cyber crime. Seeing just how much is at risk, and how unprepared so many individuals and companies are, is what pushes me into this field, and why it is important now more than ever to keep cyber security in mind when developing anything that touches the internet or critical systems.</p> <p>My interest in cyber security was born in 2023. I was undecided with how I wanted to puruse my interest in computer science. There were so many paths and while I wouldn’t mind any of them, they also weren’t calling me. Eventually, I stumbled upon a article talking about a recent attack that resulted in millions of people having their personal info being leaked onto the net (Something that we see practically ever year now). That begun the rabbit hole that led me to taking my first cyber security course online via Coursera and Google. By no means is that certification useful. What it did was give me the needed context and information to decide that this is what I want to do. It also led me to make some of my closest friends in college as I found others with the same interest at my univeristy’s ISSA club, which I would go on to become the president for.</p> <p>As a child, I imagine myself a areospace engineer, but I find that while I going in a completely different direction as to the dream, the goal has remained the same. Help create a better world than the one I was given.</p> </body></html>
